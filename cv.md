#### About me:
I'm 29 years. I am an experienced financial services seller.    
In the process of professional development, I took part in meetups,    
the purpose of which is to develop the business processes and applications    
of the company, the applications which my colleagues and I used in our work.    
I was fascinated by this process of participation and influence on the    
product, as a result of which I decided to develop in the IT sector.    
Now my mission is to develop in this area and share my experience as a    
customer and user of programs that improve people's lives.

**I want to develop so that one day I will become a successful team lead.**
